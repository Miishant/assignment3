            <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
            <p>Milk has been enjoyed by humans for an incredibly long time. Up until the early 20th century, people drank milk in its whole and non-homogenized form. With that shift came a significant loss of elements such as a rich flavor profile, until recently. There are many interesting facts about milk you probably didn’t know, so we’ve put together several that showcase milk’s fascinating history.
                While it may seem counter-intuitive, drinking high-fat whole milk has been found to help you avoid gaining weight. This is when it is compared with people drinking low-fat milk. It’s believed that whole milk is less likely to make us fat due to bioactive substances in it, which alter our metabolism to burn more fat.

            <h2>Nutritional Information</h2>
            <p>The nutritional composition of milk is highly complex. It contains almost every single nutrient that your body needs
                One cup (249 grams) of whole cow’s milk with 3.25% fat provides (1Trusted Source):
                Calories: 152
                Water: 88%
                Protein: 8.14 grams
                Carbs: 12 grams
                Sugar: 12 grams
                Fiber: 0 grams
                Fat: 8 grams
                Milk is a rich source of protein — providing approximately 1 gram of this nutrient in each fluid ounce (30 mL), or 8.14 grams in each cup (249 grams) (1Trusted Source).
                Proteins in milk can be divided into two groups based on their solubility in water:
                Insoluble milk proteins are called casein.
                Soluble milk proteins are known as whey proteins.
                Both groups of milk proteins are considered to be of excellent quality, with a high proportion of essential amino acids and good digestibility.</p>
